// Introducing C
// C - Versatile, and low level language
// C is a General-Purpose Programming Language that has been around for nearly 50 years.
// C has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) 
// to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more.
// The versatility of C is by design. It is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn.
// *** Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language. ***
