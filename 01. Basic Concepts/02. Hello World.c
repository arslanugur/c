// Hello World!

// As when learning any new language, the place to start is with the classic "Hello World!" program: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

// Let's break down the code to understand each line:
// #include <stdio.h> The function used for generating output is defined in stdio.h. 
// In order to use the printf function, we need to first include the required file, also called a header file.

// int main() The main() function is the entry point to a program. 
// Curly brackets { } indicate the beginning and end of a function (also called a code block). 
// The statements inside the brackets determine what the function does when executed. 

// List of inbuilt C functions in stdio.h file: 
// printf() This function is used to print the character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values onto the output screen 
// scanf() This function is used to read a character, string, numeric data from keyboard. 
// getc() It reads character from file gets() It reads line from keyboard getchar() 
// It reads character from keyboard puts() It writes line to o/p screen putchar() It writes a character to screen clearerr() 
// This function clears the error indicators f open() 
// All file handling functions are defined in stdio.h header file f close() closes an opened file getw() reads an integer from file 
// putw() writes an integer to file f 
// getc() reads a character from file 
// putc() writes a character to file f 
// gets() reads string from a file, one line at a time f 
// puts() writes string to a file f 
// eof() finds end of file more at https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/why-a-header-file-such-as-includestdioh-is-used/
